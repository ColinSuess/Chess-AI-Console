# Chess-AI-Console

<h1>Purpose:</h1>

<p>
  This is meant to be a chess program made for the purpose of developing an AI.

<h2> Moves: </h2>

<p>
  To start playing the game in two player mode just enter a move for white (the uppercase letters) then continue playing as black entering 
  a move.

  Moves are entered as such: first enter the the letter followed by the number of square the piece you wish to move is on.

  Next, enter the coordinates of the position you'd like to move in the same way.
  
  So if you'd like to move to the pawn on C2 to C3 you would type C2C3.
